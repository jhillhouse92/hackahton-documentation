<div class="l-main-section"><h2>Setting up a Veteran Facing App - VA Moms</h2><p>VA Moms is a tool and information source for women Veterans who are pregnant or breastfeeding.  
With this mobile app, women Veterans can enter information from their prenatal and postpartum appointments, 
write notes about topics they want to remember or share with their health care team, and find links to resources 
about pregnancy and breastfeeding.  The VA Moms application in conjunction with MCC Support will enhance the care 
coordination and sharing of electronic information between the Veteran, the Maternity Care Coordinator (MCC), 
key VA providers, and the Veteranâ€™s non-VA maternity care provider (if desirable).
